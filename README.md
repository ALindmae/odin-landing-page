# Odin Landing Page

This is my landing page created as part of the [Odin Project Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Aim of the Project
The goal of this project was to build a landing page using **HTML** and **CSS**, mimicking the structure of a static design provided by The Odin Project.

## Tools Used
- HTML  
- CSS  

## What I Learned
- Plan and create a full HTML structure independently  
- Apply CSS styling for layout and design  
- Use Flexbox for responsive positioning
